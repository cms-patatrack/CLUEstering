  "title": "CLUEstering",
  "description": "CLUEstering is a density-based weighted clustering library based on a highly parallel and scalable algorithm, CLUE, which was developed at CERN. The library is designed to be performance portable, supporting both CPU and GPU architectures, and is implemented in C++20 using the Alpaka framework for heterogeneous computing. CLUEstering is suitable for high-performance computing environments and can be used in various applications requiring efficient clustering of large datasets.",
